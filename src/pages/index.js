			<p>
				In pursuance of the National Action Plan of the National Assessment and
				Accreditation Council (NAAC), Bangalore, for performance evaluation,
				assessment and accreditation and quality up-gradation of institutions of
				higher education, the NAAC proposes that every accredited institution
				establish an Internal Quality Assurance Cell (IQAC) as a
				post-accreditation quality sustenance measure. Since quality enhancement
				is a continuous process, the IQAC will become a part of an institution's
				system and work towards realizing the goals of quality enhancement and
				sustenance. The prime task of the IQAC is to develop a system for
				conscious, consistent and catalytic improvement in the performance of
				institutions. The IQAC will make a significant and meaningful
				contribution in the post-accreditation phase of institutions. During the
				post-accreditation period, the IQAC will channelize the efforts and
				measures of an institution towards academic excellence.
